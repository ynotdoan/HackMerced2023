# Mooday Tracker :D

Project for HackMerced VIII at UC Merced

## Description
This project is a part of the Health & Wellness track.
Mooday Tracker is an app that promotes mental wellbeing by allowing users to track how they are feeling everytime they log into the app. The users can see a history of how they felt all week and how their friends are feeling on the dashboard. On the profile page, the user can see more in depth about they have been feeling in the past 30 days. 

For the daily check-ins, users will choose from one of three moods (smiley face to sad face). For each option, the user would have to enter a short description about why they are feeling the way they are. However, if the sad face is chosen, the user is required to fill out reasons they think they feel that way and reasons that oppose why they think they are feeling that way. Afterward, they are asked to revise their description from earlier in-order to promote a more balanced mindset. In other words, this extra activity is done in-order to promote more positive thoughts.
